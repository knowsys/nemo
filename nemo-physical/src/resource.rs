/// Resource that can be referenced in source declarations in Nemo programs
/// Resources are resolved using `nemo::io::resource_providers::ResourceProviders`

/// Resources currently can be either an IRI or a (possibly relative) file path.
/// TODO: It is not clear why this needs to be in `nemo-physical` given that it is only used and
/// resolved by code in `nemo`.

# Nemo

*Nemo* is a datalog-based rule engine for fast and scalable analytic data processing in memory. It is available as a command-line tool ```nmo```.

Goals of Nemo are performance, declarativity, versatility, and reliability. It is written in Rust. Nemo's data model aims at compatibility with [RDF](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/)/[SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-overview/) while preservig established logic programming conventions and features. The following formats are currently supported:
- Input: CSV, TSV
- Rules: datalog dialect with support for existential rules (tuple-generating dependencies) and datatypes
- Output: CSV

Nemo's datatypes allow the use of RDF-style data values but also "plain" names and constants in any of these formats.

Nemo is in heavy development and the current releases should still be considered unstable. 

## Installation

To build from source, download the source code (from a release or this repository) and run

 `cargo build -r`
 
This will create the command-line client `nmo` in the directory `./target/release/`.

## Usage

Run the following command for an overview of current options:

`nmo --help`

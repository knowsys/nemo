*Nemo* is a datalog-based rule engine for fast and scalable analytic data processing in memory. It is available as a command-line tool ```nmo```,  through bindings to other programming languages, and via a [browser-based web application](https://tools.iccl.inf.tu-dresden.de/nemo/).

Goals of Nemo are performance, declarativity, versatility, and reliability. It is written in Rust. Nemo's data model aims at compatibility with [RDF](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/)/[SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-overview/) while preserving established logic programming conventions and features. The following formats are currently supported:
- Input: CSV, TSV, [DSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delimiter-separated_values), [N-Triples](https://www.w3.org/TR/n-triples/), [Turtle](https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/), [RDF/XML](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/), [N-Quads](https://www.w3.org/TR/n-quads/), [TriG](https://www.w3.org/TR/trig/)
- Rules: datalog dialect with support for existential rules (tuple-generating dependencies), stratified negation, and datatypes (including numeric comparison and arithmetic functions)
- Output: CSV, TSV, [DSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delimiter-separated_values), [N-Triples](https://www.w3.org/TR/n-triples/), [Turtle](https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/), [RDF/XML](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/), [N-Quads](https://www.w3.org/TR/n-quads/), [TriG](https://www.w3.org/TR/trig/)

Nemo's datatypes allow the use of RDF-style data values but also "plain" names and constants in any of these formats.

The following [publication](https://github.com/knowsys/nemo/wiki/Publications) gives a first overview of the system and can be used for citing Nemo:

Nemo is in heavy development and the current releases should still be considered unstable.

## Trying Nemo online

We provide a [live online demo](https://tools.iccl.inf.tu-dresden.de/nemo/) that you can try in your browser.
The application is based on the [Nemo browser integration](https://github.com/knowsys/nemo/wiki/Browser-integration) and runs entirely
on your browser. Performance will therefore vary depending on your machine and browser (we found Firefox to be fastest).

## Installation

The fastest way to run Nemo is to use system-specific binaries of our [command-line client](https://github.com/knowsys/nemo/wiki/Nemo-client).
Archives with pre-compiled binaries for various platforms are available from the
[Nemo releases page](https://github.com/knowsys/nemo/releases).
To build your own version from source, you need to have an up-to-date installation of Rust.
Moreover, Nemo requires the following dependency on Linux/Unix systems:
- OpenSSL development packages (e.g., `libssl-dev` on Ubuntu or `openssl-devel` on Fedora; you may also need to install `pkg-config`)

Download the source code (from a release or this repository) and run

 `cargo build -r`

This will create the command-line client `nmo` in the directory `./target/release/`.

## Usage

Run the following command for an overview of current options:

`nmo --help`

Further details are found in the [Nemo client documentation](https://github.com/knowsys/nemo/wiki/Nemo-client).
Example Nemo programs and datasets can be found in the [Nemo Examples repository](https://github.com/knowsys/nemo-examples).

## Help

Detailed information for users and developers is found in the [Nemo documentation](https://github.com/knowsys/nemo/wiki/Nemo-documentation).
Feel free to use [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/knowsys/nemo/discussions) to ask questions or talk about Nemo.

[Bug reports](https://github.com/knowsys/nemo/issues) are also very welcome.

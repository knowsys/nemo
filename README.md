*Nemo* is a datalog-based rule engine for fast and scalable analytic data processing in memory. It is available as a command-line tool ```nmo```.

Goals of Nemo are performance, declarativity, versatility, and reliability. It is written in Rust. Nemo's data model aims at compatibility with [RDF](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/)/[SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-overview/) while preserving established logic programming conventions and features. The following formats are currently supported:
- Input: CSV, TSV
- Rules: datalog dialect with support for existential rules (tuple-generating dependencies) and datatypes
- Output: CSV

Nemo's datatypes allow the use of RDF-style data values but also "plain" names and constants in any of these formats.

Nemo is in heavy development and the current releases should still be considered unstable. 

## Installation

Archives with pre-compiled binaries for various platforms are available from the
[Nemo releases page](https://github.com/knowsys/nemo/releases).
To build your own version from source, you need to have an up-to-date installation of Rust.
Download the source code (from a release or this repository) and run

 `cargo build -r`
 
This will create the command-line client `nmo` in the directory `./target/release/`.

## Usage

Run the following command for an overview of current options:

`nmo --help`

Example Nemo programs and datasets can be found in the [Nemo Examples repository](https://github.com/knowsys/nemo-examples).
